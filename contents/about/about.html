        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="text-start">Hi, my name is Salman Alfarissy, I have experiences as a web developer for the last 2
            years. Technology stacks that have been used are PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, Livewire, and Laravel. Each
            project development has been implementing a clean architecture using repository pattern.<br>

            I can do collaborative work and always curious of new things. To maintain projects with the team, we use
            version control (Github/Gitlab). Furthermore, when the world changing, I always discovering and learning the
            latest technology. Besides, I also played around with Flutter, Android, and frontend stuff like Vue.js.<br>

            I believe that my experience and skills will contribute to the successful development and creation of web or
            mobile applications.</p>
